Ok, I followed the requirements and added those files. We are still waiting on some final updates to the readmes from our product owner which should be complete by the end of this week.

These are API client reference implementations for our new open APIs exposed on Mastercard Developers and need to be publicly available.

Hi Matt,
Thanks.
For requirements those two repositories must meet, please have a look at Project Expectations And Obligations. In particular, you will need a README, a license, and removing internal stuff (BTE, Artifactory, ...). 
Also, can you explain why they are good candidate to be open sourced?
In term of GitHub team(s), can you confirm we can create a single team for all projects?

1.	Your JAMStack context in your service object is incorrect.  The custom form will not work until you fix this. You must also check the same value in your repos pipeline configuration
2.	Custom forms do not yet support a max length, so this validation will not apply
3.	The two values being asked for seem like they come from Mastercard and would being going against the grain of Mastercards open API goals. Please ensure that you check with the team that this custom form wonÕt hamper your onboarding/scoring

Re: Go language implementation of client encryption library,"Hi John,

Subject: Re: Go language implementation of client encryption library

Hi James,

All of our encryption libraries only support 2 methods of decryption, âA128CBC-HS256â and âA256GCMâ.

When we initially started development on these libraries, we did an audit of all of the services that offered JWE encryption on Mastercard Developers and only found these 2.

The expectation from Mastercard Services is that they use 1 of the 2 supported encryption methods.

There are a large number of encryption methods that can be used with JWE, and supporting all of them for all of the languages we support would be unmaintainable.

Is it possible for the service to change the method of encryption it uses?

We announce updates and new releases on our teams channel. I would suggest you join that channel.

If your service is using JWE (current Mastercard Developers API Standard  there should be alternatives customers can use to implement JWE
